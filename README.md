# ZTNA-ML Project (Starting Point)

This is my starting point for learning and building a project around Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) with Machine Learning.

## Current Status
- Repo Created
- README added
- Next step: Create project structure

## Why this project?
I want to build a strong portfolio and stand out in cybersecurity + ML. This repo will slowly grow from zero to a full research-grade project.

## Next Tasks
1. Add basic folder structure
2. Add sample dataset
3. Add first python script
